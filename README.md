# Urgency Classifier

## 1. Background and Motivation
Let's say there are two messages for help â€“ one where a house is in a raging fire, and the other is where someone got a slight burn on their finger. Which call should be responded to and helped with first?
<br />
<br />
In emergency response scenarios, time is of the essence. Imagine two incoming messages: one reporting a house engulfed in flames and another describing a minor burn on a finger. Which message should be prioritized? For humans, this decision is intuitive, but for machine learning models, it requires sophisticated algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand context and urgency.
The ability to automatically classify the urgency of support tickets or emergency messages can significantly enhance response times and resource allocation, potentially saving lives and improving service efficiency. Developing such a machine learning (ML) model involves creating an NLP system that can interpret and prioritize textual information based on its urgency.
In this project, we aim to build a robust ML model: the Urgency Classifier. This classifier will analyze text descriptions of support tickets or emergency messages and classify them into different urgency levels. By leveraging the power of transformers and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), our model will be trained to understand the context and urgency embedded within the text.

## 2. Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the Chartered Accountancy question-answering model consists of a collection of textual content related to various topics in the field of CA. The dataset is stored in a CSV file with the following columns:

Topic: The category or topic of the question (e.g., "Accounting Standards", "Taxation", "Corporate Law").
Content: The actual content or description from the dataset (e.g., accounting standard, tax law).
Question: A relevant question related to the content.
Answer: The corresponding answer, either model-generated or manually curated.

## 3. Structure
* `Files` urgency_classifier.py: The main script for training and evaluating the urgency classifier model. README.md: This readme file.
* `data` customer_support_tickets.csv data (csv) we used to train model

## 4. Technologies Used and Requirements for Use
* `Python`
* `PyTorch`: open-source machine learning library used for building and training the model.
* `Transformers (Hugging Face)`: A library providing pre-trained transformer models, including BERT.
* `Pandas`: data manipulation and analysis library.
* `scikit-learn`: library used for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
* `TQDM`: library for displaying progress bars during training.
